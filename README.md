Revel Software Engineer Practical Exercise

This is my solution for the utilizing data from the OpenWeatherMap API to calculate customer engagement strategies based on the weather forecast for Minneapolis over the next five days. 

Usage:

Clone the repository locally.
Open a command window in the directory where the repo was cloned.
Execute 'java -jar RevelTest.jar' from the command line.

Notes:

Because the weather in Minneapolis over the next week will be early winter-like, I incorporated a function to fudge the results of the API request. The first seven records of the result have altered temperature and condition values intended to test the three requirements specified in the document.
